# 1fD3forceGraphNetwork
1fD3forceGraphNetwork displays relationships graphically. It's a locally executable one-file (1f) HTML/Javascript solution, the data is embedded as well as the only used library ([D3](https://github.com/d3/d3)).

Separating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (plus SVG in this case) into distinct files is considered best practice in web development, but this project isn't about building for the web. It's a one-file solution about having complex context briefly explained graphically in a small single file that can be sent without hassle and that will work locally without dependencies on other files.

The nodes (circles) can be dragged to get a different view of the network connections.
Any relationships can be represented by adapting the object "graph" with "nodes" and "links".
